# Preliminary Architecture Proposal: AI Driving Tutor Chatbot (v0.1)

## 1. Overview

This document outlines a preliminary high-level architecture for the AI Driving Tutor Chatbot. It proposes a modular design separating concerns for the user interface, backend logic, AI processing, and data management. The goal is to create a scalable, maintainable system capable of delivering the core features outlined in the initial requirements.

## 2. Core Components

*   **Frontend Application(s):**
    *   **Description:** User interfaces for Students and Tutors. Likely web-based applications, potentially mobile apps in the future. Handles user interaction, displays information, and communicates with the Backend API. Could be a single application with different views/roles or separate applications.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Rendering UI, capturing user input (chat messages, scenario interactions), displaying chatbot responses, visualizing progress.

*   **Backend API:**
    *   **Description:** Central service acting as the "brain" behind the frontend. Handles business logic, user authentication/authorization, data orchestration, and communication with other components (Database, AI Service).
    *   **Responsibilities:** Managing user sessions, processing requests from the frontend, fetching/storing data via the Database, coordinating with the AI Service for NLP and scenario logic, managing user progress.

*   **AI Service / Chatbot Engine:**
    *   **Description:** Handles the core AI functionalities, primarily Natural Language Processing (NLP) / Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for interpreting user messages and generating responses. May also contain logic for driving scenario simulation and feedback generation. Could leverage external cloud AI platforms or be a custom-built service.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Intent recognition, entity extraction, dialogue management, generating natural language responses, executing scenario logic, analyzing user performance in simulations.

*   **Database:**
    *   **Description:** Persistent storage for all application data.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Storing user profiles (students, tutors), authentication credentials, chat history, student progress data, scenario definitions, knowledge base content (rules, regulations, FAQs).

*   **Knowledge Base Store:**
    *   **Description:** A dedicated store or mechanism for managing the driving rules, regulations, theory questions, and scenario content. Could be part of the main Database or a separate system optimized for content management and retrieval (e.g., a vector database for semantic search if advanced Q&A is needed).
    *   **Responsibilities:** Storing, versioning, and providing efficient access to the educational content used by the Backend API and AI Service.

## 3. Technology Considerations

*(Note: These are initial suggestions and require further evaluation)*

*   **Frontend:** React, Vue, or Angular (for web). React Native or Flutter (if mobile apps are considered).
*   **Backend API:** Node.js (Express/NestJS), Python (Django/Flask), Go (Gin). Choice depends on team expertise and performance needs.
*   **AI Service / Chatbot Engine:**
    *   **External Platforms:** Google Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework / Azure AI Language, Rasa (open-source).
    *   **Custom:** Python with NLP libraries (spaCy, NLTK) and potentially ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) if building custom models.
*   **Database:**
    *   **Relational:** PostgreSQL or MySQL (good for structured user data, progress tracking).
    *   **NoSQL:** MongoDB (flexible schema, potentially good for chat logs or less structured content). A combination might be suitable.
*   **Knowledge Base Store:** PostgreSQL (if primarily structured text), Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) if semantic search/RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is desired for Q&A.

## 4. Data Flow

    end

    AI -- Potentially Uses --> ExtAI;

```

**Description:**
1.  Users interact with the Frontend Application.
2.  The Frontend sends requests (e.g., chat messages, requests for progress) to the Backend API.
3.  The Backend API authenticates the user, potentially queries the Database for user data or session info.
4.  For chat or scenario logic, the Backend API sends relevant data (user message, context) to the AI Service.
5.  The AI Service processes the input, potentially querying the Knowledge Base Store for rules/content or the Backend API for more context. It may leverage external AI platforms.
6.  The AI Service returns a response or analysis (e.g., chatbot reply, scenario feedback) to the Backend API.
7.  The Backend API may store results/progress in the Database or Knowledge Base Store.
8.  The Backend API formats the final response and sends it back to the Frontend.
9.  The Frontend displays the response to the user.

## 5. AI Integration Points

*   **NLU/NLP:** The AI Service is the primary integration point for understanding user text input (intents, entities).
*   **Dialogue Management:** The AI Service manages the conversation flow.
*   **Knowledge Retrieval:** The AI Service needs efficient access to the Knowledge Base Store to answer questions accurately. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) could be employed here.
*   **Scenario Logic:** The AI Service may execute the logic for simulated driving scenarios.
*   **Feedback Generation:** The AI Service could analyze user performance in scenarios to provide personalized feedback.

## 6. Key Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) to Consider

*   **Accuracy:** Information provided (rules, theory) must be correct and up-to-date for the target region. Requires careful Knowledge Base management.
*   **Response Time:** Chat interactions should feel near real-time. Scenario simulations need acceptable latency.
*   **Availability:** The service should be reliably available, especially if used frequently by students.
*   **Scalability:** Architecture should handle a growing number of students, tutors, and potentially driving schools.
*   **Maintainability:** Easy to update the knowledge base (rules, scenarios), AI models, and application logic.
*   **Security:** Protect user data (PII, progress) and ensure secure authentication/authorization.
*   **Data Privacy:** Comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR if applicable).
*   **Regionalization:** Design for potential adaptation to different regions' driving rules and languages.
