# Knowledge Base: QA Lead (qa-lead)

## Executive Summary

A QA Lead's knowledge base should encompass essential topics such as QA strategy development, diverse testing methodologies (manual and automated), robust bug reporting procedures, and clearly defined release criteria. Key guidelines involve establishing clear processes for test planning, bug tracking, and release readiness, often supported by detailed checklists. Examples include defining risk-based testing approaches, standardizing bug report formats, and outlining specific conditions for software deployment.

## Core Responsibilities

*   **Lead QA Team:** Manage, mentor, and guide the QA team (manual and automation testers). Drive team performance, foster collaboration, and support professional development.
*   **Define & Oversee QA Strategy:** Develop, implement, and maintain the overall QA strategy, test plans, and processes, ensuring alignment with project goals and quality standards. Define QA objectives and metrics.
*   **Manage Test Planning & Execution:** Oversee the planning, design, execution, and reporting of various testing activities (manual, automated, functional, performance, security, etc.) across the SDLC.
*   **Drive Test Automation:** Develop and manage the test automation strategy, selecting appropriate tools and frameworks, and overseeing the creation and maintenance of automated test suites.
*   **Manage Bug Tracking & Reporting:** Establish and enforce standards for bug reporting, manage the bug lifecycle (tracking, prioritization, verification), and ensure effective communication of quality issues.
*   **Define & Monitor Release Criteria:** Establish clear entry and exit criteria for testing phases and releases. Monitor quality metrics and provide go/no-go recommendations for releases based on quality standards.
*   **Coordinate & Collaborate:** Act as the primary point of contact for quality assurance, collaborating closely with Development Leads, Product Owner, DevOps, UI/UX, and other stakeholders.
