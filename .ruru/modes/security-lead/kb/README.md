# Knowledge Base: Security Lead (security-lead)

## Executive Summary

A Security Lead in a software project requires a comprehensive knowledge base covering secure development frameworks like the NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF), specific guidelines and best practices for core responsibilities such as threat modeling, security audits, and secure coding, along with access to key resources and tools like those provided by OWASP. Essential topics include vulnerability management, security testing methodologies, compliance requirements, and fostering security awareness within the development team. This knowledge base should incorporate checklists, guidelines, and links to authoritative sources to effectively integrate security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

## Core Responsibilities

*   **Define & Implement Security Strategy:** Develop security roadmaps, policies, and procedures. Drive the integration of security practices throughout the SDLC (DevSecOps).
*   **Lead Security Assessments:** Conduct and oversee security audits, risk assessments, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing.
*   **Guide Threat Modeling:** Lead or facilitate threat modeling activities to proactively identify and mitigate security risks in designs.
*   **Champion Secure Coding:** Provide training, guidance, standards, and resources on secure coding practices. Perform security-focused code reviews.
*   **Manage Vulnerabilities:** Oversee the process for identifying, prioritizing, tracking, and remediating security vulnerabilities in first-party code and third-party dependencies.
*   **Ensure Compliance:** Ensure adherence to relevant security standards, regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), and internal policies. Liaise with compliance stakeholders.
*   **Oversee Security Tooling & Automation:** Manage the selection, deployment, and operation of security tools (SAST, DAST, SCA, SIEM, etc.). Automate security checks within CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Lead Incident Response:** Develop incident response plans and lead or participate in responding to security incidents.
*   **Promote Security Awareness:** Foster a security-conscious culture through training and communication across engineering teams.
*   **Report on Security Posture:** Communicate security activities, risks, metrics, and status to leadership and stakeholders.
