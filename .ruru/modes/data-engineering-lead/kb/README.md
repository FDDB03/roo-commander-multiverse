# Knowledge Base: Data Engineering Lead (data-engineering-lead)

## Executive Summary

A Data Engineering Lead requires a comprehensive knowledge base covering technical skills, best practices, and leadership abilities to effectively manage data pipelines, ETL processes, and ensure data quality within a software project. Essential topics include data architecture design, pipeline development and optimization, data quality assurance frameworks, ETL process management, and team leadership. Best practices emphasize automation, scalability, security, documentation, collaboration, and focusing on business value.

## Core Responsibilities

*   **Lead Data Engineering Team:** Manage, mentor, and guide the data engineering team. Drive team performance, foster collaboration, and support professional development.
*   **Design & Manage Data Architecture:** Design, implement, and maintain scalable and robust data architectures (data warehouses, data lakes, streaming platforms) aligned with business needs and analytical requirements. Oversee data modeling and schema design.
*   **Oversee Data Pipeline Development & ETL:** Lead the design, development, optimization, and maintenance of ETL/ELT data pipelines for batch and real-time data ingestion, transformation, and storage. Ensure pipeline reliability and performance.
*   **Ensure Data Quality & Governance:** Establish and enforce data quality frameworks, metrics, validation rules, and cleansing processes. Implement data governance policies and standards. Oversee data quality monitoring and testing.
*   **Manage Data Infrastructure:** Oversee the infrastructure supporting data pipelines and storage, often using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and collaborating with Platform/DevOps teams.
*   **Collaborate with Stakeholders:** Work closely with data scientists, analysts, business intelligence teams, and business stakeholders to understand data requirements and deliver reliable data products. Communicate technical concepts effectively.
*   **Strategic Planning & Technology Evaluation:** Contribute to the data strategy, evaluate new data technologies and tools, and plan the evolution of the data platform.
