Essential topics include the onboarding program's structure and strategy, detailed role definitions, procedures for initial project setup (including tools and access), communication plans, standardized checklists and timelines, training resources, and established best practices. Various templates exist for knowledge base articles, role definitions, and project setup guides, which can streamline the creation process.
