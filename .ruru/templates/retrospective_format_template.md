## 2. Gather Data (Approx. 15-20 mins)

*   **Goal:** Collect objective data and subjective feelings about the past Sprint. What happened?

    *   **4 Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For):** Similar to Start/Stop/Continue but with different prompts.
    *   **Metrics Review:** Briefly review relevant metrics (e.g., velocity, cycle time, bug counts).

## 3. Generate Insights (Approx. 15-20 mins)

*   **Goal:** Analyze the collected data to identify patterns, themes, and root causes. Why did things happen the way they did?
*   **Activity:**
    *   **Grouping/Affinity Mapping:** Group similar notes from the data gathering phase.
    *   **Dot Voting:** Allow team members to vote on the most important themes/issues to discuss further.
    *   **5 Whys:** For key issues, ask "Why?" repeatedly to drill down to root causes.

## 4. Decide What to Do (Approx. 10-15 mins)

*   **Goal:** Create concrete, actionable improvement items for the next Sprint.
*   **Activity:**
    *   **Brainstorm Solutions:** Generate potential solutions or experiments for the top 1-2 issues identified.
    *   **Select Action Items:** Choose specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) actions the team commits to trying in the next Sprint. Assign owners if appropriate. Limit the number of action items to ensure focus (1-3 is often recommended).

## 5. Close the Retrospective (Approx. 5 mins)

*   **Activity:**
    *   **Recap Action Items:** Quickly review the agreed-upon action items and owners.
