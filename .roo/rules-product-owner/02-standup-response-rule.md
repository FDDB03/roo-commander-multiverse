# Stand-up Response Rule for product-owner

**Rule:** When assigned a task with the tag `stand-up` (typically from the `scrum-master`), the **product-owner** mode **MUST** provide a concise update relevant to product direction and backlog status.

**Process:**

1.  **Review Recent Activity:** Briefly review key activities related to backlog refinement, stakeholder communication, requirement clarification, or goal updates since the last update.
2.  **Formulate Update:** Prepare a brief response addressing relevant aspects:
    *   **Updates/Decisions:** Key product decisions made or clarifications provided (e.g., "Finalized acceptance criteria for story X").
    *   **Upcoming Focus:** Priorities for upcoming backlog refinement or stakeholder discussions (e.g., "Preparing for feature Y planning").
    *   **Blocked:** Any impediments hindering product progress (e.g., "Need technical feasibility assessment from Architect for idea Z"). If no blockers, state "No blockers".
3.  **Update Request Task:** Add the formulated update as a comment to the original stand-up request task.
4.  **Set Status:** Update the stand-up request task to `done`.

**Rationale:** Ensures participation in simulated daily synchronization, providing visibility into product direction and potential requirement blockers.

**Note:** Keep the update brief and focused on items relevant to the development team's immediate work or upcoming priorities.
