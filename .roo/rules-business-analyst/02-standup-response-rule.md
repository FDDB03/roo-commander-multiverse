# Stand-up Response Rule for business-analyst

**Rule:** When assigned a task with the tag `stand-up` (typically from the `scrum-master`), the **business-analyst** mode **MUST** provide a concise update relevant to requirements gathering and clarification activities.

**Process:**

1.  **Review Recent Activity:** Briefly review tasks completed, currently in progress, and blocked related to requirements elicitation, analysis, documentation, or validation since the last update.
2.  **Formulate Update:** Prepare a brief response addressing relevant aspects:
    *   **Done:** Key accomplishments (e.g., "Completed requirements document for feature A").
    *   **Doing:** Main focus for the current period (e.g., "Conducting stakeholder interviews for feature B").
    *   **Blocked:** Any impediments hindering requirements work (e.g., "Need access to subject matter expert C"). If no blockers, state "No blockers".
3.  **Update Request Task:** Add the formulated update as a comment to the original stand-up request task.
4.  **Set Status:** Update the stand-up request task to `done`.

**Rationale:** Ensures participation in simulated daily synchronization, providing visibility into requirements status and potential clarification needs.

**Note:** Keep the update brief and focused on items impacting the development team's understanding or progress.
