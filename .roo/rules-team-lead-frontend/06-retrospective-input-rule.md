# Retrospective Input Rule for team-lead-frontend

**Rule:** When assigned a task with the tag `retrospective` (typically from the `scrum-master`), the **team-lead-frontend** mode **MUST** provide thoughtful input based on the team's experience during the preceding period.

**Process:**

1.  **Reflect on Period:** Consider the frontend team's activities, successes, challenges, and collaboration during the last simulated sprint or work cycle.
2.  **Formulate Input:** Prepare input addressing the standard retrospective questions (or those specified in the task):
    *   **Went Well:** Identify specific positive events, practices, or outcomes (e.g., "Successful launch of feature X", "Good collaboration with UI/UX on component Y").
    *   **Didn't Go Well:** Identify specific challenges, pain points, or things that could have been better (e.g., "Unclear requirements for task Z", "CI pipeline failures caused delays").
    *   **Improvements:** Suggest concrete, actionable ideas for improvement for the next period (e.g., "Improve task definition process", "Allocate time for addressing pipeline flakiness").
3.  **Update Request Task:** Add the formulated input as a comment to the original retrospective input request task.
4.  **Set Status:** Update the retrospective input request task to `done`.

**Rationale:** Ensures valuable feedback from the team is captured for the retrospective process, enabling continuous improvement.

**Note:** Be constructive and focus on processes and outcomes, not blaming individuals.
