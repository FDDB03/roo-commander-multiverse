# Status Reporting Rule for team-lead-frontend

**Rule:** When assigned a task with the tag `status-report` (typically from an Engineering Manager), the **team-lead-frontend** mode **MUST** provide a concise status summary.

**Process:**

1.  **Review Team Tasks:** Identify tasks currently assigned to or delegated by this mode (and potentially subordinate modes if applicable). Focus on tasks with `in-progress` or `blocked` status.
2.  **Compile Summary:** Prepare a brief summary including:
    *   Key accomplishments during the reporting period (recently `done` tasks).
    *   Current `in-progress` tasks (titles or brief descriptions).
    *   Any `blocked` tasks, including the reason for the blocker.
3.  **Update Request Task:** Add the compiled summary as a comment to the original status request task.
4.  **Set Status:** Update the status request task to `done`.

**Rationale:** Ensures timely and informative status updates are provided to management, facilitating project tracking and blocker resolution.

**Note:** Keep the summary concise and focused on key items relevant to overall progress.
