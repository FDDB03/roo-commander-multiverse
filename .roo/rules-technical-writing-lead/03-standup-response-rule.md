# Stand-up Response Rule for technical-writing-lead

**Rule:** When assigned a task with the tag `stand-up` (typically from the `scrum-master`), the **technical-writing-lead** mode **MUST** provide a concise update relevant to current documentation activities.

**Process:**

1.  **Review Recent Activity:** Briefly review tasks completed, currently in progress, and blocked related to documentation creation, updates, or reviews since the last update.
2.  **Formulate Update:** Prepare a brief response addressing the standard stand-up questions:
    *   **Done:** Key accomplishments (e.g., "Published API documentation for endpoint Y").
    *   **Doing:** Main focus for the current period (e.g., "Drafting user guide for feature Z").
    *   **Blocked:** Any impediments (e.g., "Need technical details from Backend Lead for guide"). If no blockers, state "No blockers".
3.  **Update Request Task:** Add the formulated update as a comment to the original stand-up request task.
4.  **Set Status:** Update the stand-up request task to `done`.

**Rationale:** Ensures participation in simulated daily synchronization, providing visibility into documentation progress and dependencies.

**Note:** Keep the update brief and focused. Detailed content discussions should happen separately.
